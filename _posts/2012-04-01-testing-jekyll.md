## Cyberduck

It looks like Cyberduck, when not carefully used, will screw up my directory,
or else it is trying to tell me that I should have an empty directory,
or it will try to synchronize (badly) because it only knows what it should
upload, but not download.

I also need to name my categories more carefully. It is precisely this sort
of yak shaving that I don't want to do any coding, and why I would rather
use Blogger or WordPress or some other software where these background
stuff can be ignored.
