I found a solution to avoid having to use Cyberduck to upload files to
NearlyFreeSpeech.net, which I didn't like having to do. As this is part
of the process of making blogging using Jekyll be seamless as possible,
which I acknowledge is simply my desire to do things on my own and force
myself not to be lazy, since Blogger makes it so easy, I followed
[hayley.ws](http://hayley.ws/2010/12/04/getting-jekyll-running.html)'s guide.

This is my first post since I make all the required changes. Now, I am going
to save this file, git commit and all that, and push to nfsn and see 
if it updates correctly.

I also might consider changing the name of the repo on Github.com to get
rid of the duplicated site.
