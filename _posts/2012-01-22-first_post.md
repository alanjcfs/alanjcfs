# Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

I purchased an ebook from Barnes & Noble, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. It was my first time
reading the novella. It was not a long read, but it was an engrossing tale. It gave me
a different impression of the characters than I expected. It always seemed to be portrayed
as simply that of a monster who took over the character of Dr. Jekyll, but in reality,
it was Dr. Jekyll's own darker aspect that he purified from himself.

And yet, it didn't seem to me as simple as that. It's actually a pretty frightening story.
The author used plenty of words to menace my brain, such that I didn't need pictures.
I could imagine, just with the use of "disgust" and "deformity", I could find myself feeling
a bit of terror in my own mind.

It was this that prompted me to read Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Have you read it before?
I was surprised it was not a long book, and yet, it was sufficiently engrossing. I like
how the writer used certain adjectives like "disgustful curiosity" and describing Mr. 
Hyde as someone who didn't have a deformity and yet came across as deformed. Describing 
the haunting mood of London and the directions of footsteps. Such descriptions generated 
a feeling of predatory menace in me without needing a picture. I was expecting a monster, 
a murderous criminal based on my reading of the popular view, but the story was curiously 
more complicated than that. Mr. Hyde was really Dr. Jekyll, and yet it seemed like only
time was needed before Hyde could take over in a certain sense--that while it was still Dr.
Jekyll, it was really Dr. Jekyll with a childish tantrum.

Wonderful to think on.

I was also pondering on the pre-moving picture age, as there was a 'scene' in which Mr. Utterson was having a fitful dream after learning about Mr. Hyde stomping on a child and how Mr. Enfield had described him. It was quite deft how Stevenson made run-on sentences feel like the repetition of a dream, struggling to put a face on Mr. Hyde that keeps evading him.
