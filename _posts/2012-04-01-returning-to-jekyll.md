This post is intended to signal my return to using Jekyll, not that I
have ever left. I have mostly been sending replies to OhLife everyday,
along with being busy at work. When I come home, I usually want to read stuff,
but I do not want to learn.

upgrade. I'm sure there is a way, but I don't yet know how.
