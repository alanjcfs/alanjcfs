h1. Thoughts.

I didn't sleep very well last night, and I know why. I didn't drink enough water,
I woke up repeatedly with some thirst. I didn't get full sleep, including dreams.
That is why I am feeling tired tonight.

I am going to Macworld/iWorld, where I think the name change will only confuse people
who already do not know how to spell Macworld (i.e. capitalizing the double-u).
