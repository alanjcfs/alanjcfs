## A Disappointment

I watched The Iron Lady hoping to be entertained, but it wound up being
disappointing in so many ways. I think the movie was in one way too faithful
to the history, and in the other way too experimental. The point about 
Margaret Thatcher's apparent hallucination of her dead husband felt ridiculous
and I was annoyed at the flashing back and forth. Meryl Streep simply couldn't
carry the entire movie. By the end, I was sick of it.

It was boring.

My opinion was that there was simply no narrative constructed, but Ebert's
opinion was that the director and screenwriter seemed to have no opinion of her.
She was a fact, and all we have after this is simply a couple of images of her
and you come out of the picture with what you saw, but not what you can
respond to emotionally.

In this way, the way Thatcher spoke about loving ideas more than feelings
might have gone too far. The movie should have been made for the people.

It was pretty shitty.

I felt like it could have been made better if things were condensed, if some
facts could be thrown out so that she becomes a force of nature. It doesn't
have to be completely accurate to work; it just has to have a good narrative,
which it lacked.

I always think of Shakespeare or of those great plays/movies where the facts
were made to submit to the need for great storytelling, like Incendies.
