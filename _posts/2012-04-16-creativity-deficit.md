# Creativity Deficit

It's sad but true, I have a creativity deficit. I may be able to absorb information,
summon up trivia, remember a lot of things, but not the things I'm supposed to.

I am just smart, but I am not a hard-working problem-solving creative.

For what is creativity? I am twenty-seven, turning twenty-eight in May, but compared to others
I live in a socialist paradise I want to get out of, but I cut myself off at every 
turn. I complain to myself how much I hate being on the telephone, but I have to be.

Why then can't I find a creative solution to it? Maybe I should just put one phone number, 
my TextFree number, and then tell them that I want to call them. Figure out a way for them
to contact me first so that they will have to follow up when it comes time that I need
the Video Relay Service.

I know, I am just unlucky I chose a career that bears no fruit. Chemistry is supposed to
be in demand, but it isn't, not since 2007, which I was able to get an almost offer. I regret
not taking it, instead wanting to go to Ohlone College. It was a dumb mistake.

How then, can I prevent myself making the same mistake again? It is a mistake of personality,
of being inflexible, of wanting to pursue my own goal when I should have realized where I sit
in society, the imbalance between where I want to be and how to get there. I could easily have
taken C++ when I realized I wanted to, and it would have been fine because Impax Laboratories
is close to home, and Chabot is a fine place to go for a computer science class. And if I want
to continue, I easily could have left my job a year or so later, maybe 2009, to feel out 
a master's degree in computer science. 

Maybe life wouldn't have worked so well the way I see it, especially since the housing crash 
of 2008 might have put a bunker mentality on me, making me cling to my job for dear life, 
and perhaps I would have been seeking to move out much earlier, if I was earning enough at
that time.
